ANSWER:
"""
# This error is due to an assertion error that is raised when the tokens in self.full_orig_tokens have a different value from the tokens in without_tpos.
# The specific KeyError indicates that the file path c:\\Users\\user\\Games\\new.py could not be found in the dictionary.
# This likely indicates that the text used for tokenization is not being found.
